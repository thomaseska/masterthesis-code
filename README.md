Code for my masterthesis "Deconvolution of Bulk RNA-Sequencing Data Focusing on T-cell Subtypes"

The most important scripts are listed below. All scripts are configured with data locations. To view different results paths need to be changed internally.

Scripts are meant to be used interactively. Some code snippets are meant for different situations even if they are in the same script.

## General
Load `helpers.R` first

## Dataset Creation
Use `final_datasets.R`

## Deconvolution Analysis
Use `deconv_analysis.R` for normal deconvolutions

Use `simulation_analysis.R` for simulations
